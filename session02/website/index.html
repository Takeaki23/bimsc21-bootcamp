    <h2> Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools </h2>
    <h1> MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022 </h1>

    <p class="special-items"> In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools. </p>

    <p id="nice"> First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em>Git</em>, which 
    can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called <a href="www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.
    Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor <strong>Visual 
    Studio Code</strong>, which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
    a web server. </p> 

    <p class="special-items">In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
    componentes for modern web development: </p>

    <ol>

        <li>HTML       </li>
        <li>CSS        </li>
        <li>Javascript </li>

    </ol>

    <p>Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
    a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github. </p>

    <p>If you want to see how that looks like, then this is a preview:</p>
